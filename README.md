# Project Name

**Author**: Chris L Chapman
**Version**: 1.2.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Pat has a few stores for selling his Salmon Cookies. He would like to have sales.html that calculates the daily sales (currently based
on his estimates of minum and maximum number of customers, and his estimate of average cookies sold to each customer). If possible, it would be nice to also have that page show how many staff members he should have for each location based on the volume of sales each hour and with some limits on the minimum number of staff members needed at a store. He also would like a page for his customers to view about his company. This website should use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
