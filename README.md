## Overview
Pat has a few stores for selling his Salmon Cookies. He would like to have sales.html that calculates the daily sales (currently based
on his estimates of minum and maximum number of customers, and his estimate of average cookies sold to each customer). If possible, it would be nice to also have that page show how many staff members he should have for each location based on the volume of sales each hour and with some limits on the minimum number of staff members needed at a store. He also would like a page for his customers to view about his company. They can also add new stores with the same
parameters. At this point these additional stores are temporary since we are not saving it outside of the run of th script.
